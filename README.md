# Jiwoon Park / 박지운

I am currently working for the government of South Korean.

## Background

I was a math PhD student in the [CCIMI](https://www.ccimi.maths.cam.ac.uk), at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk). My supervisor was [Roland Bauerschmidt](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bauerschmidt/).

## Research Interests

My main research field is the lattice field theory, which is in the intersection of probability theory and mathematical physics. 

I work with [renormalisation group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization_group) method.
