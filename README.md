# Jiwoon Park / 박지운

I am currently working for the government of South Korea (mainly sweeping and cleaning goverment facilities).

## Background

I attained a Ph.D. degree in mathematics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk). My advisor was [Roland Bauerschmidt](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bauerschmidt/).

- Here is a link to my thesis: [Two-Dimensional Discrete Gaussian Model at High Temperature](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/11ecd706-f552-4cb2-a331-1b351ccb38f1)

## Research Interests

My main research field is the lattice field theory, which is in the intersection of probability theory and mathematical physics. 

I work with [renormalisation group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization_group) method.
